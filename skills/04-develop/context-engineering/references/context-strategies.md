# Context Strategies

Detailed reference for the `context-engineering` skill: context packing
strategies, MCP integrations, and anti-patterns.

## Context Packing Strategies

### The Brain Dump

At session start, provide everything the agent needs in a structured block:

```
PROJECT CONTEXT:
- We're building [X] using [tech stack]
- The relevant spec section is: [spec excerpt]
- Key constraints: [list]
- Files involved: [list with brief descriptions]
- Related patterns: [pointer to an example file]
- Known gotchas: [list of things to watch out for]
```

### The Selective Include

Only include what is relevant to the current task:

```
TASK: Add email validation to the registration endpoint

RELEVANT FILES:
- src/routes/auth.ts (the endpoint to modify)
- src/lib/validation.ts (existing validation utilities)
- tests/routes/auth.test.ts (existing tests to extend)

PATTERN TO FOLLOW:
- See how phone validation works in src/lib/validation.ts:45-60

CONSTRAINT:
- Must use the existing ValidationError class, not throw raw errors
```

### The Hierarchical Summary

For large projects, maintain a summary index:

```markdown
# Project Map

## Authentication (src/auth/)
Handles registration, login, password reset.
Key files: auth.routes.ts, auth.service.ts, auth.middleware.ts
Pattern: All routes use authMiddleware, errors use AuthError class

## Tasks (src/tasks/)
CRUD for user tasks with real-time updates.
Key files: task.routes.ts, task.service.ts, task.socket.ts
Pattern: Optimistic updates via WebSocket, server reconciliation

## Shared (src/lib/)
Validation, error handling, database utilities.
Key files: validation.ts, errors.ts, db.ts
```

Load only the relevant section when working on a specific area.

## Rules File Template (CLAUDE.md)

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Tech Stack
- React 18, TypeScript 5, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4
- Node.js 22, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma

## Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint --fix`
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Type check: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## Code Conventions
- Functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Named exports (no default exports)
- colocate tests next to source: `Button.tsx` → `Button.test.tsx`
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classNames
- Error boundaries at route level

## Boundaries
- Never commit .env files or secrets
- Never add dependencies without checking bundle size impact
- Ask before modifying database schema
- Always run tests before committing

## Patterns

## MCP Integrations

| MCP Server | What It Provides |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Context7** | Auto-fetches relevant documentation for libraries |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Live browser state, DOM, console, network |
| **PostgreSQL** | Direct database schema and query results |
| **Filesystem** | Project file access and search |
| **GitHub** | Issue, PR, and repository context |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Context starvation | Agent invents APIs, ignores conventions | Load rules file + relevant source files before each task |
| Context flooding | Agent loses focus with >5000 lines of non-task context | Include only what is relevant; aim for <2000 lines per task |
| Stale context | Agent references outdated patterns or deleted code | Start fresh sessions when context drifts |
| Missing examples | Agent invents a new style instead of following yours | Include one example of the pattern to follow |
| Implicit knowledge | Agent doesn't know project-specific rules | Write it down in rules files — if it's not written, it doesn't exist |
| Silent confusion | Agent guesses when it should ask | Surface ambiguity explicitly using the confusion management patterns |

## Red Flags

- Agent output doesn't match project conventions.
- Agent invents APIs or imports that don't exist.
- Agent re-implements utilities that already exist in the codebase.
- Agent quality degrades as the conversation gets longer.
- No rules file exists in the project.
- External data files or config treated as trusted instructions without
  verification.
